## UPDATE
Some users have problems installing the fonts in Windows.
I'm investigating the problem... if you have any trouble, pleas contact me with a PM at the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/My-Guitar-Fonts-450268108496016/">"My Guitar Fonts" Facebook Page</a>
## UPDATE 2
Turns out that the problem is in direct downloading the files from github.
Download as zip file and you should be OK...

# MyGuitarFont
Welcome to my page dedicated to some font file I created to ease the editing of guitar fretboard diagrams in a regular word processor.

_After google modified the share policiy I'm transferring the content on this github page, hoping the files will be more easly accessible._

I struggled for years with various drawing programs, trying to find a quick way to write on the fly those diagrams.
I had no luck until I saw recently a website selling "guitar fretboard fonts", that illuminated  the way!
Building a custom font file could allow me to write my documents AND write diagrams without leaving the editing program, simple, elegant.

So I started googling for "fonts", "editors", "open source", and came up with some freely available programs, plus some online resource, that allowed me to quickly build the first prototype of my "guitar font".

I was always interested in Ted Greene (<a href="http://www.tedgreene.com/">www.tedgreene.com</a>) diagrams to visualize note shapes and voice movement, with his well known (at least between us followers) combination of symbols displaced on paper. An intelligent way to render the dynamic nature of an arrangement, using the "visual" side of the instrument.

So why not start with that?
That's how the Ted-Chemist font idea was born

In this page you'll find a link to a downloadable zip file containing the font file to install (it's not complicated, you can easily find how by  searching online), and a quick guide on how to use it. With time I'll write some more complete documentation.
I'm currently working on a refined version of the file and other variants for the symbols, so stay tuned for updates!

It's not the simplest thing, you have to follow a small learning curve, but after that editing the diagrams is a piece of cake... and any feedback (in particular about the keyboard layout) is appreciated. I developed on an italian keyboard, trying to maintain compatibility with the international US keyboard, but didn't test in deep.You can contact me for support, suggestions, whatever, at my <a href="https://www.facebook.com/My-Guitar-Fonts-450268108496016/">"My Guitar Fonts" Facebook Page</a>

Feedback is <b>VERY</b> appreciated!
I use this font with <a href="http://www.libreoffice.org/">LibreOffice</a></div>
